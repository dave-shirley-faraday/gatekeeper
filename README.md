# Gatekeeper

The idea with this is to have a very lightweight 'app' - just a webpage - that helps head gatekeepers divide up a course and synchronize the gatecards, where numbering can be a little off sometimes.

## Intended usage

Start at the top, and dictate into your phone as you are going down the course: "start, red, blue, red, blue, ..., double red, double blue, ..., blue, red undergate, blue, ..., finish".  You can also annotate hill features (crest etc), flag, edit later, and also flip sides manually.  See the grammar reference in the page for specific details.

When you are done, you'll have a text description of the course.  Click to generate a numbered diagram, and you'll be able to see what all the gate numbers are, and where hill features are.  If you have distinctive features (like flushes, hairpins etc) you can easily reference their numbers when showing gatekeepers which gates they should be watching.  You can screenshot their section and text it to them if you need to.
